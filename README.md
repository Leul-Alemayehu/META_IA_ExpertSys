# **Expert System for Periodic Table Elements Identification**

This project serves as an intermediary system that facilitates the creation of a Prolog-based expert system. The Prolog system identifies elements based on user-provided physical and chemical properties. To streamline the user experience, a Java-based GUI is implemented as an intermediary step. This GUI allows users to input element properties conveniently and exports the data as a JSON file, which is then ingested into the Prolog knowledge base.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

The ultimate goal of this project is to build an expert system in Prolog that can identify periodic table elements using user-provided **physical and chemical properties** (instead of solely relying on atomic numbers or mass). 

### üõ†Ô∏è **Why Java GUI?**
Directly working with Prolog's input is cumbersome and prone to errors. The Java GUI serves as an intermediary interface:
1. Users input data about elements (e.g., properties like electronegativity, group, or period, etc.) into a user-friendly form.
2. The Java application converts these inputs into a **JSON file**.
3. This JSON is consumed by Prolog and loaded into its knowledge base.

---

## ‚ú® **Features**

The Java GUI application provides the following features:
- **User Input Form**: Input various physical and chemical properties related to periodic table elements.
- **Combo-box Selection**: Choose element properties (e.g., Group and Period values) from dropdown menus.
- **Data Export**: Save user inputs into a JSON format compatible with Prolog knowledge base ingestion.
- **Reset Input Fields**: Clear the fields to input new data easily without restarting the application.
- **JSON Generation**: Data exported is in a structured JSON format, ready for use in the Prolog expert system.

---

## üíª **Technologies Used**

### **Java**
- Java Swing for GUI development.
- Java libraries for JSON handling.

### **Prolog**
- The Prolog expert system will process the JSON data to identify elements based on logical inference.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

The system consists of:
1. **Java GUI Application**:
   - Provides a user-friendly interface to input element properties.
   - Includes fields with drop-down lists (combo boxes) for common properties such as **Group** and **Period** values.
   - A "reset" button clears inputs for reuse.

2. **JSON Serialization**:
   - Input data is exported as a JSON file.
   - This JSON file serves as the bridge between Java and the Prolog knowledge base.

3. **Prolog Knowledge Base**:
   - The final system component, which will read this JSON file and act as the expert system logic engine.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup & Installation**

### Prerequisites
1. **Java Development Environment**: Ensure Java is installed on your system.
   - Download Java from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. **IDE**: Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, or Eclipse for a smooth development experience.

---

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leul-Alemayehu/META_IA_ExpertSys
cd META_IA_ExpertSys
```

---

### **Build & Run**

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Compile the application (or let your IDE handle this).
3. Run the Java GUI application.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **Usage Instructions**

1. **Launch the Application**:
   - Open the GUI through your IDE or compiled Java binary.

2. **Fill in the Fields**:
   - Input the element's properties like electronegativity, chemical symbols, etc., through the GUI's form fields.

3. **Select Options**:
   - Use dropdown combo boxes for "Group" and "Period" values.

4. **Export JSON**:
   - Once input is complete, click the **Save/Export** button. This will generate a `data.json` file.

5. **Use with Prolog**:
   - Load the generated JSON file into the Prolog knowledge base to run inference.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Next Steps**

The current focus of the Java GUI is:
- Complete the input form functionality.
- Implement proper serialization into JSON.
- Enable integration with Prolog by transforming user-provided JSON into a Prolog-compatible format.

Once ready, the JSON data will seamlessly interface with the Prolog knowledge base for intelligent element identification based on physical/chemical properties.

## üß† **Final Thought**

The Prolog expert system represents the final goal ‚Äî this Java intermediary GUI reduces complexity by enabling intuitive user interactions while ensuring data compatibility with logical inference mechanisms in Prolog.

Happy coding! üöÄ
